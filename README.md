# ComposePlayground

In order to taste new, declarative approach to write Android apps, this project was created. It features:

* Kotlin DSL instead of Groovy
* Hilt dependency injection framework
* Navigation component
* Ktor for networking
* Coil image library
* Kotlin Coroutines
* Jetpack Compose

Compose, Compose, Compose! This new declarative framework made possible even the deepest decomposition of th UI. It fetures good old ConstraintLayout, so there is no loss in functionality compared to XML markdouwn.

Living, breathing system in conjunction with Hilt, NavComponent and Compose!
